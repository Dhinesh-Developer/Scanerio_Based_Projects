ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement (Zoho-style)

Design and implement a console-based Employee Management System in Java.

The application should allow an HR/admin to perform the following operations:

Add Employee â€“ Enter employee details and save.

View Employees â€“ Display all employees.

Search Employee â€“ Search employee by ID or Name.

Update Employee â€“ Update details (e.g., salary, department).

Delete Employee â€“ Remove employee by ID.

Exit â€“ Quit the application.

ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Use Java Collections (ArrayList / HashMap) for storing employees.

Each employee should have:

Employee ID (unique, int)

Name (String)

Age (int)

Department (String)

Salary (double)

Console-based menu-driven application (loop until user exits).
