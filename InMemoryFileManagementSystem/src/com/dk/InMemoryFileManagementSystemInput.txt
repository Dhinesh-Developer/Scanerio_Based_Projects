ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement: In-Memory File Management System

You need to design and implement a console-based File Management System that simulates basic file operations in memory (not on actual disk).

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements

Entities: 

A File should have:
File name (unique inside a folder)
File content (text)
File size (auto-calculated from content length)
A Folder should have:
Folder name (unique inside parent folder)
Can contain multiple Files and Subfolders
Operations (Menu-driven)

--- File Management System ---
1. Create Folder
2. Create File
3. Write Content to File
4. Read File Content
5. List All Files and Folders
6. Delete File
7. Delete Folder
8. Exit


Rules:

No two files with the same name inside one folder.
No two folders with the same name inside one folder.
File size updates automatically when content changes.
Deleting a folder should delete all its files and subfolders.
