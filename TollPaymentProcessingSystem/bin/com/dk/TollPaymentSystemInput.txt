Question: Toll Payment Processing System
Application Description:
There are ’n’ points on a highway. Some of these points are toll gates.
Each toll gate has a unique charging scheme based on vehicle type (Car, Bike, Truck) and whether the user is VIP.
VIP users receive a 20% discount on toll charges.
A vehicle passing through multiple tolls must pay at each toll according to its respective scheme.
The highway is considered circular, allowing vehicles to travel in both directions.


Modules:
Process Journey
Calculate the toll charges for a journey, including discounts if applicable.
Display Toll Details
Display details of vehicles passing each toll and the total revenue collected.
Display Vehicle Details
Show journeys taken by each vehicle, tolls passed, and total toll charges paid.
Find Shortest Route and Calculate Toll
Identify the shortest path between two points and calculate the toll.
Exit
Terminate the program.


Solution Design
To solve this, I used object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and broke down the problem into six classes:
