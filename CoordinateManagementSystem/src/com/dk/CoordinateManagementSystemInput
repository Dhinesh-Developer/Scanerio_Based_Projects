ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Build a menu-driven Java program that allows the user to create and manage points on a 2D plane, and perform operations such as distance calculation, nearest/farthest points, and searching within a radius.

âœ… Requirements
1. Entity: Point

Each point has:

ID (unique, auto-generated)

X-coordinate (int/float)

Y-coordinate (int/float)

2. Functionalities (Menu Options)
--- Coordinate Management System ---
1. Add a Point
2. View All Points
3. Find Distance between Two Points
4. Find Nearest Point to Origin (0,0)
5. Find Nearest Point to a Given Point
6. Find All Points within a Radius
7. Exit

3. Distance Calculation

Formula:

distance = âˆš((x2 - x1)Â² + (y2 - y1)Â²)


Example: Point1 = (3,4), Point2 = (0,0) â†’ Distance = 5

4. Business Rules

No duplicate IDs â†’ Each point must have a unique auto-generated ID.

Negative coordinates allowed (since points can be in all 4 quadrants).

If no points exist, operations should display an error message.

If multiple points are at the same nearest distance â†’ return any one.
