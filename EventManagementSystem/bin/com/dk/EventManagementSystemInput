ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement: Event Management System

Design and implement a console-based Event Management System in Java.

Requirements:

An event has:

Event ID (unique, auto-generated)

Event Name

Organizer

Date

Venue

Total Seats

Booked Seats

Users can perform the following actions:

Create Event (Add new event details)

View All Events (list all created events)

Book Ticket for an event (reduce available seats, store booking info)

Cancel Ticket for an event (free up a seat)

Search Event by name or ID

Delete Event (only if no tickets booked)

Each booking stores:

Booking ID

Customer Name

Event ID

No. of Tickets booked

System must prevent overbooking (cannot book more seats than available).

Menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Sample Menu
--- Event Management System ---
1. Create Event
2. View Events
3. Book Ticket
4. Cancel Ticket
5. Search Event
6. Delete Event
7. Exit

Constraints

Use OOP concepts: Event class, Booking class, EventManager class.

Use Collections (ArrayList/HashMap) to manage events and bookings.

Handle edge cases:

Booking when no seats are available.

Cancelling with an invalid booking ID.

Deleting an event that already has bookings.
