🎯 Requirements

Game Setup

The board is a 3×3 grid.

Two players: Player X and Player O.

Players take turns marking an empty cell with their symbol (X or O).

A player wins if they have 3 of their marks in:

a row, OR

a diagonal.

Game End Conditions

If a player wins, print “Player X/O Wins!”.

If all cells are filled and no winner, print “It’s a Draw!”.
