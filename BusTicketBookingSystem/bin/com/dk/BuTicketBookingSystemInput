Problem Statement: Bus Ticket Booking System

You are asked to design a simple Bus Ticket Booking Application in Java.

A bus has a limited number of seats. Passengers can book tickets if seats are available, cancel tickets if needed, and the system should properly handle seat allocation.

Requirements:

The bus has a fixed number of seats (say 40).

A passenger can:

		Book a ticket if seats are available.
		
		Cancel a ticket (free up the seat).
		
		View available seats.
		
		View booked passenger details.
		
		Each booking should store passenger details:

				Name
				
				Age
				
				Gender

Seat Number (assigned automatically based on availability)

If no seats are available, booking should fail with a proper message.

If a ticket is cancelled, the seat should become available for the next booking.

The system should be menu-driven (console-based).

Sample Menu:
1. Book Ticket
2. Cancel Ticket
3. View Available Seats
4. View Booked Tickets
5. Exit

Constraints:

Only one passenger can occupy a seat.

Seat numbers should be unique and automatically assigned in order.

Try to use Object-Oriented Design (Passenger class, Bus class, BookingManager class, etc.).
