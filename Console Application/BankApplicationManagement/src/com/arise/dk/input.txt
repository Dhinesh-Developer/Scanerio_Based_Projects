üè¶ Problem Statement: Bank Account Management System

You are required to design and implement a console-based Bank Account Management System using OOP concepts (Java preferred).
The system should allow multiple users to create and manage their bank accounts.

Functional Requirements
Create Account
User enters name, account number, initial balance, account type (Savings/Current).
Store account details.
Deposit Money
User can deposit a specific amount into their account.
Balance should be updated accordingly.
Withdraw Money
User can withdraw money if balance is sufficient.
Show error if withdrawal amount exceeds balance.
Check Balance
Display current balance of the account.
Transfer Money
Transfer funds from one account to another.
Validate account numbers and balance before transfer.
Transaction History
Maintain a simple record of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers for each account.
Exit Application
Gracefully close the application when user chooses to exit.


Constraints / Rules (Zoho-style twist)
Use OOP principles:
Account class with attributes (accountNumber, name, balance, type).
Methods like deposit(), withdraw(), transfer(), getBalance().
Use a collection (ArrayList / HashMap) to manage multiple accounts.
Input/output must be handled via console (Scanner).
Ensure error handling for invalid inputs (wrong account number, negative amount, insufficient balance).
Optional (Zoho often asks): Add interest calculation for savings accounts.

Expected Usage Flow (Example)
Create an account ‚Üí Name: "Dhinesh", Acc No: 1001, Balance: 5000.
Deposit 2000 ‚Üí Balance = 7000.
Withdraw 1000 ‚Üí Balance = 6000.
Transfer 2000 from Acc No 1001 ‚Üí Acc No 1002.
Show transaction history ‚Üí Deposited 2000, Withdrawn 1000, Transferred 2000.
